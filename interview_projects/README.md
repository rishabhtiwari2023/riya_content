# Interview Project Templates for Riya

This folder contains four small, well-documented Python projects suitable for a Class-10 student to present in an interview. Each project includes:
- A short **README** explaining the project and how to run it
- A **starter implementation** with clear functions and docstrings
- **Unit tests** (simple assert-based or pytest-friendly) to show testing knowledge
- **Presentation notes** with a short demo script and talking points

Projects included:
1. Number Guessing Game (CLI)
2. Gradebook (CSV reader + stats)
3. Text Analyzer (word counts and common words)
4. Calculator CLI (safe arithmetic evaluation)

How to use:
- Open any project folder and read its `README.md` for instructions
- Run tests with `python -m pytest` (or run each test file directly)
- Use the `05_project_showcase.ipynb` notebook to prepare a short demo and presentation script

Tips for interviews:
- Practice a 30–60 second "elevator pitch" for each project (what it does, why it's useful, one challenge you solved)
- Show code snippets and explain how functions work, and how you tested them
- Be ready to explain a small extension or improvement you would add next

Good luck presenting — make it fun and confident! 🎉
